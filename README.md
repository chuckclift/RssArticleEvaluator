# RssArticleEvaluator


This is a small project for the purpose of generating inputs for a machine learning program
and applying those inputs to score articles from rss feeds.  The first program prints out
the article a few lines at a time, and at the end of the article, it prompts the user for
a categorization(from categories.txt).  This data can then be used to train the second program
to select articles.
   

This is a personal project, so feel free to use this code however you want to.
